# Lab 3 – Basic Switch and End Device Configuration

This lab simulates a small local area network (LAN) using two managed switches and two PCs. 
I'll configure basic switch settings including hostname, secure access, interface status, and system identification. 
The lab also includes basic IP addressing and connectivity testing using `ping`.


## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a simple LAN with two switches and two PCs  
- Assign static IP addresses to switches and PCs  
- Configure basic switch settings: hostname, passwords, banner  
- Verify connectivity and interface status using show commands


## 🧱 Network Topology (Simplified)


| Device     | Interface | IP Address     | Subnet Mask     |
|------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Switch-1   | VLAN 1    | 192.168.1.1    | 255.255.255.0   |
| Switch-2   | VLAN 1    | 192.168.1.2    | 255.255.255.0   |
| PC-A       | NIC       | 192.168.1.10   | 255.255.255.0   |
| PC-B       | NIC       | 192.168.1.11   | 255.255.255.0   |


## 🛠️ Commands Used
### 🔹 On Switch-1
```bash

enable
configure terminal
hostname Switch-1
no ip domain-lookup
enable secret NetCore2023!
line console 0
 password AccessLab#1
 login
exit
line vty 0 4
 password AccessLab#1
 login
exit
interface vlan 1
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
exit
banner motd # Unauthorized Access is Prohibited #
copy running-config startup-config


### 🔹 On Switch-2

enable
configure terminal
hostname Switch-2
no ip domain-lookup
enable secret NetCore2023!
line console 0
 password AccessLab#1
 login
exit
line vty 0 4
 password AccessLab#1
 login
exit
interface vlan 1
 ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
exit
banner motd #Unauthorized Access is Prohibited#
copy running-config startup-config


### 🖥️ PC Configuration

| PC   | IP Address   | Subnet Mask   | Default Gateway |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| PC-A | 192.168.1.10 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.1.1     |
| PC-B | 192.168.1.11 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.1.2     |


### ✅ Verification Steps

show running-config
show version
show ip interface brief

ping between:
PC-A ↔ Switch-1
PC-B ↔ Switch-2
PC-A ↔ PC-B

### 🔒 Security Note

Device models and passwords have been replaced with generic identifiers to preserve academic and operational security. 
This lab is for simulation and learning purposes only.


### 🧠 Reflection

Why are some FastEthernet ports on the switches up while others are down?
What might prevent successful pings between PCs?
