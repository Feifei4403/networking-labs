# Lab 2 – Console Access and Basic IOS Navigation Using Terminal Emulator

This lab simulates accessing a network switch through the **console port** using a serial or USB connection. 
Using a terminal emulator (e.g. Tera Term), we establish a local connection to the device, display basic system information, and configure the system clock. 
This foundational lab is part of our Networking Labs Series and emphasizes physical device access before remote management.

## 🔒 Security Note

All real device model names, ports, and IP data have been generalized to protect institutional configurations and hardware details. 
This lab is a simulation for educational use only.


## 🎯 Objectives

- Establish a serial console connection using a terminal emulator.
- Access the switch CLI through local console port.
- Identify the device IOS version and basic system info.
- Configure and verify the system clock using privileged EXEC mode.


## 🧱 Lab Setup

### Hardware Used

| Device        | Description                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 x Switch    | Any Cisco-like Layer 2 switch    |
| 1 x PC/Laptop | With Tera Term or similar tool   |
| 1 x Console Cable | Rollover (RJ-45 to DB-9) or Mini-USB |


## 🛠️ Steps Summary

### 🔌 Part 1: Physical Connection

1. Connect the console cable to the switch's **console port**.
2. Connect the other end to your PC (USB or serial COM).
3. Power on both devices.


### 🧭 Part 2: Establish Console Session

1. Open **Tera Term** (or similar emulator).
2. Select the correct **Serial COM port**.
3. Confirm console settings: `9600 baud, 8N1, no flow control`.


### 🖥️ Part 3: Navigate and Configure

#### Example CLI Commands Used:

```bash
Switch> enable
Switch# show version
Switch# show clock
Switch# clock set 15:08:00 Oct 26 2023
Switch# show clock

  -show version: Displays IOS version and device info.
  -clock set: Updates system clock manually.
  -show clock: Verifies the new time.
