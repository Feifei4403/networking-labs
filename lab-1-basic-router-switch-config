# Lab 1 – Basic Router and Switch Configuration

## 📝 Notes

This lab simulates a typical configuration recovery task where the running configuration was lost due to a power failure. 
Reconfiguration was done manually using Cisco IOS commands, and full network functionality was restored.
This lab demonstrates a basic Cisco network setup using Packet Tracer. It includes one router, two switches, and four PCs spread across two subnets. 
The lab simulates reconfiguration of a network after a configuration loss, with full restoration of IP addressing, interface connectivity, password protection, and device access control.


## 🎯 Objectives

- Configure router interfaces with IP addresses
- Set up secure access:
  - Console and VTY passwords
  - Encrypted `enable secret`
  - MOTD login banner
- Configure static IP addresses on PCs
- Set correct default gateways
- Verify connectivity with `ping`
- Save configuration to NVRAM


## 🧱 Network Topology

| Device      | Role      | IP Address       | Interface            |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|-----------------------|
| CoreRouter  | Router    | 192.168.4.1      | G0/0/0                |
|             |           | 192.168.104.1    | G0/0/1                |
| Switch1     | Switch    | N/A              | Connected to PC1/PC2 |
| Switch2     | Switch    | N/A              | Connected to PC3/PC4 |
| PC1         | End Host  | 192.168.4.10     | Default GW: 192.168.4.1 |
| PC2         | End Host  | 192.168.4.11     | Default GW: 192.168.4.1 |
| PC3         | End Host  | 192.168.104.10   | Default GW: 192.168.104.1 |
| PC4         | End Host  | 192.168.104.11   | Default GW: 192.168.104.1 |


## 🔧 Router Configuration Summary

```bash
enable
configure terminal
hostname CoreRouter

interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
 description Link to Switch1
 ip address 192.168.4.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
exit

interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1
 description Link to Switch2
 ip address 192.168.104.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
exit

enable secret NetCore2023!

line console 0
 password AccessLab#1

exit

line vty 0 4
 password AccessLab#1
 login
exit

service password-encryption
banner motd #Authorized access only - Employee Only#
end

copy running-config startup-config


## ✅ Results

All PCs were successfully assigned static IPs
Ping tests between devices across subnets were successful
Configuration secured with encrypted access
Configuration saved and backed up
